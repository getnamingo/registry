# 3. Domains List Page

The **Domains** section of the Namingo Control Panel provides a centralized interface for viewing and managing all domain records in the registry system. This list view is optimized for both large-scale TLD operations and fine-grained domain-level tasks, offering a responsive, filterable, and action-driven experience.

## Features and Interface Elements

### Top Controls

- **Export Buttons**
  - **CSV**: Export the visible list of domains in Comma-Separated Values format.
  - **PDF**: Generate a print-ready PDF report of the domain list.

- **Check Domain** (üîç)
  - Opens a domain availability search field.
  - Lets administrators or registrars check whether a domain name is available for registration or already exists.

- **Create Domain** (‚ûï)
  - Launches the domain creation form.
  - Used for manually registering a new domain via the UI.

- **Search Bar**
  - Real-time filtering of the domain list by keyword (e.g., domain name, registrant ID).
  - Supports partial matches and case-insensitive search.

## Domain Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Displays the domain's full name (FQDN). Usually a clickable link to the domain details page. |
| **Registrant** | Shows the unique identifier or handle of the registrant contact associated with the domain. |
| **Creation Date** | Timestamp of when the domain was first registered. Uses millisecond precision for registry auditing. |
| **Expiration Date** | Timestamp indicating when the domain will expire unless renewed. |
| **Status** | A tag-style visual showing the domain‚Äôs current EPP status (e.g., `ok`, `pendingDelete`, `clientUpdateProhibited`, etc.). Multiple statuses may be displayed depending on the domain state. |

## Domain Statuses

Common domain statuses include (but are not limited to):

- `ok`: Domain is active and in good standing.
- `addPeriod`: Domain is within the add grace period after initial registration.
- `pendingDelete`: Domain is scheduled for deletion and cannot be renewed.
- `clientUpdateProhibited`: Client-side restriction preventing domain updates.
- `serverHold`: Domain is inactive at the registry level.

These statuses are color-coded (green, orange, red) for faster visual scanning.

## Action Icons (Per Row)

Each domain row includes a set of action buttons depending on the domain‚Äôs lifecycle state:

- üñäÔ∏è **Edit**
  - Opens the domain details/edit page.
  - Allows updating DNS settings, contact associations, and status flags.

- üëÅÔ∏è **View**
  - Opens a read-only page showing domain details, including registry events and current status.

- üîÅ **Renew**
  - Available when the domain is active.
  - Initiates a renewal for the selected domain, extending its expiration date.

- üóëÔ∏è **Delete**
  - Moves the domain into `pendingDelete` or `redemptionPeriod` depending on registry policy.
  - Only visible if the domain is eligible for deletion.

- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Restore**
  - Available when the domain is in redemption or pending delete phase.
  - Restores the domain to an active state and may incur a restore fee per registry policy.

> Additional buttons may appear depending on enabled modules or extensions.

## UX Notes

- All actions are permission-guarded: only authorized roles (e.g., `admin`, `registry operator`) can see or execute sensitive actions like deletion, restoration, or editing restricted fields.
- Users only see domains associated with their registrar account or privileges. For example:
  - **Registrar users** see only domains under their own registrar's management.
  - **Registry operators** and **admins** see all domains across the system.
- The table supports column sorting by **Name**, **Creation Date**, and **Expiration Date** for quick access and filtering.
- If multi-language UI is enabled, all status labels, action buttons, and system messages are localized according to the user‚Äôs selected language or browser preference.

## 3.1 Applications List

The **Applications** section in the Namingo Control Panel displays all domain applications submitted during special registration phases, such as Sunrise or Landrush. Applications are similar to domains in structure but represent a *pending request* to register a domain name under specific eligibility or policy constraints.

### Purpose

This interface allows registry administrators to:
- View incoming domain applications.
- Evaluate application data (such as claims, signed marks, allocation tokens).
- Approve or reject based on registry policies or validation rules.

### Application Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | The domain name being applied for. Often submitted during a launch phase (e.g., `Sunrise`). |
| **Applicant** | Registrant contact ID or handle associated with the application. |
| **Creation Date** | The timestamp when the application was received. |
| **Phase** | The launch phase (e.g., `sunrise`, `landrush`, `custom`) during which the application was submitted. |

### Application Statuses

- `pending`: The application is received and awaiting review.
- `validated`: The application has passed basic checks (e.g., valid SMD, allocation token).
- `approved`: The domain can now be created from the application.
- `rejected`: The application has been denied, often with a reason.

Statuses are displayed with visual tags (color-coded) for rapid scanning.

### Actions (Per Row)

| Icon | Action |
|------|--------|
| üñäÔ∏è | **Edit** ‚Äì View and edit application metadata if allowed (e.g., update documents or allocation tokens). |
| ‚úÖ | **Approve** ‚Äì Converts the application into an active domain, completing the lifecycle. |
| ‚ùå | **Reject** ‚Äì Marks the application as rejected, optionally prompting for a rejection reason. |
| üìÑ | **View** ‚Äì Opens a read-only view of the full application details, including supporting documents. |

### UX Notes

- Only authorized users (e.g., `registry admin`) can approve or reject applications.
- Applications can be filtered and sorted by domain name, phase, submission date, or status.
- Registrars may view only their own submitted applications.
- Export buttons may be provided (CSV, PDF) for audit trail and compliance.

## 3.2 Transfers List

The **Transfers** section shows all ongoing and completed domain transfer requests between registrars. This section provides oversight and control over the transfer process, especially in registries with manual review enabled.

### Purpose

This interface allows registry staff to:
- View pending inbound and outbound transfers.

| **Request Date** | Timestamp when the transfer was initiated via EPP. |
| **Status** | Current state of the transfer (e.g., `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `cancelled`). |

### Transfer Statuses

- `pending`: Transfer request has been received and is awaiting approval.
- `approved`: Transfer has been accepted and processed.
- `rejected`: Transfer was denied (often by registry intervention).
- `cancelled`: Transfer was canceled before completion (by requesting registrar or timeout).

### Actions (Per Row)

| Icon | Action |
|------|--------|
| ‚úÖ | **Approve** ‚Äì Accept the transfer request. |
| ‚ùå | **Reject** ‚Äì Deny the request based on policy or validation failure. |
| üîÑ | **Cancel** ‚Äì Cancel the pending request (if still within grace period). |
| üëÅÔ∏è | **View** ‚Äì Inspect full transfer metadata and logs. |

### UX Notes

- Transfer visibility is limited based on user role:
  - Registrars see only transfers involving their own account (as gaining or losing registrar).
  - Registry users can view and act on all transfer requests.
- Actions depend on whether manual transfer approval is enabled in registry configuration.
- Transfer logs and timestamps are retained for audit purposes and compliance.
